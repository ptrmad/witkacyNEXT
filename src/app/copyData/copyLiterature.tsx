    text: `        Published in 1927. The story revolves around Atanazy Bazakbal, a young
        decadent whose experiments lead to tragedy, and it delves into themes of
        decadence, societal change, and the impact of revolution.
        The novel tells the story of Atanazy Bazakbal, whose narcotic, erotic,
        and psychological experiments result in his wife's suicide. He becomes
        entirely dependent on Hela Bertz, a character inspired by Izabela Hertz.
        The book also reflects on the future, decadence, societal development,
        and how revolution can turn into dictatorship.
        'Farewell to Autumn' is a captivating exploration of decadence and
        revolution through the life of Atanazy Bazakbal. Witkacy's novel remains
        an insightful commentary on societal change and the potential pitfalls
        of idealism turning into dictatorship.`,

    heading: `Insatiability
`,
    text: `        Insatiability' is a speculative fiction novel that was first published
        in 1930. It is considered one of Witkacy's most notable works and is
        divided into two parts: 'Awakening' and 'The Madness'.         The novel is set in the future, around the year 2000. It envisions a
        Poland that has undergone a significant transformation. After a conflict
        resembling the Bolshevik revolution, the nation is subjugated by the
        final Mongol invasion. The Chinese leader, Murti Bing, rules with an
        iron grip and administers a special pill called DAVAMESK B 2 to the
        population, rendering them thoughtless and mentally compliant. The
        once-divided East and West now merge in a state of desolate misery
        fueled by raw sexual instincts. Witkiewicz's 'Insatiability' weaves
        together frenetic action with profound philosophical and political
        discourse. It foretells many of the political events and developments in
        the years to come, including the invasion of Poland, post-war foreign
        dominance, and the rise of totalitarian mind control under both German
        and Soviet influences. The narrative paints a vivid picture of life
        teetering on the edge, with one side representing sunny valleys of
        normality and comfort, while the other side plunges into the dark abyss
        of madness and torment. `,

    heading: `On Wiktacy's playwritting`,
    text: `
                   Witkacy penned approximately 40 dramas, though only five of them were
        officially published. These plays had their premieres in various Polish
        cities, including Krakow, Warsaw, Torun, and Lodz. Witkacy's works stood
        as a scathing mockery of the stagnant and rigid conventions of
        operettas, melodramas, and farces that inundated the Polish stage during
        the interwar period.`,

    heading: `      The Mother`,
    text: `        'The Mother' is a 1924 drama written by Stanisław Ignacy Witkiewicz. The
        play is a grotesque portrayal of the relationship between Leon
        Węgorzewski and his mother, Janina, based on the exploitation of the
        latter, especially in financial terms. Witkacy, through his created
        character, expresses many of his own views, primarily related to his
        belief in catastrophism. The drama is also a caricature of
        representative social positions, className-based social structures, and
        contemporary political systems. The story centers on Leon Węgorzewski,
        who wastes his time on contemplation and the creation of his ideological
        manifesto thanks to financial support from his mother, Janina
        Węgorzewska. His failed ambitions and prolonged crocheting work drive
        his mother to the brink of blindness, alcoholism, and drug addiction.
        When her son eventually achieves a high financial and political position
        through prostitution, espionage, and associations with a dubious
        environment, Janina feels alienated and unable to adapt to the new
        realities. The drama ends with the death of the mother during a social
        gathering, during which all the characters are under the influence of
        cocaine. In a drug-induced vision, Leon disregards her death, and in the
        epilogue, it is revealed that he is confined in a closed room and
        observed by all the other characters. In the end, he faces mob justice
        by six workers in the name of democracy. He loses both politically and
        within his family.`,

    heading: `      The Shoemakers`,
    text: ` 'The Shoemakers' is a significant political drama written by Stanisław
        Ignacy Witkiewicz between 1927 and 1934. This modernist and grotesque
        play is considered one of Witkiewicz's best and is his last drama. The
        play critiques various ideologies, including capitalism, communism, and
        fascism, and it offers a bleak view of the future of society. Witkiewicz
        presents a world where society becomes increasingly mechanized, leading
        to a profound decline in civilization. The play explores themes of
        exploitation, oppression, and the dehumanizing effects of modernization.
        The story revolves around a group of shoemakers who suffer under the
        oppressive rule of Prosecutor Scurvy. One of the striking aspects of
        'The Shoemakers' is its ability to blend philosophy with cynicism,
        profundity with coarseness, and insight with a lack of self-control. It
        presents a unique and provocative commentary on the human condition. The
        play has been adapted for the theater with great success, and it played
        a crucial role in shaping Polish drama. It's also available in English
        translation in the collection 'The Madman and the Nun, and Other Plays.`,
