          Forms in Painting and the Resulting Misunderstandings Containing the
          widely misunderstood and influenced both his painting and theater
          Theory of Pure Form' in 1919. This theory, though insightful, remained
          work. Around 1926, he shifted from oil to pastel portraits, creating a
          diverse range, from precise to purely abstract forms. Witkiewicz often
          marked his works to reflect his state while creating, including
          references to drug use, offering a unique glimpse into his artistic
          process. His experimentation with drugs in the 1930s influenced his
          art and writings. Witkacy's portraits, celebrated for their
          originality, remain highly sought after by collector Stanisław Ignacy
          Witkiewicz, or Witkacy, was a trailblazing artist and theoretician
          whose unorthodox approach to aesthetics and portraiture continues to
          fascinate art enthusiasts and scholars alike. His unconventional
          creativity has left an indelible mark on the art world.`,
