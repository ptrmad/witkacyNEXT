    text: `Born and raised in Zakopane, Stanisław Ignacy Witkiewicz, commonly known
          as Witkiewicz, had a unique upbringing. His father, in opposition to
          conventional schooling, encouraged him to explore various creative
          fields through homeschooling. However, against his father's wishes,
          Witkiewicz pursued formal education in the arts, studying at the Kraków
          Academy of Fine Arts under the guidance of Józef Mehoffer and Jan
          Stanisławski. Witkiewicz formed close friendships with notable figures
          such as composer Karol Szymanowski, anthropologist Bronisław Malinowski,
          and Zofia Romer, with whom he had romantic entanglements. His complex
          love life was reflected in his first novel, "The 622 Downfalls of Bungo
          or The Demonic Woman" (1911), where he depicted himself and others as
          characters in the story.`,

          photography, producing captivating portraits of his Zakopane circle and
          numerous self-portraits. His artistry extended to painting, and he
          embarked on a creative phase where he outlined his artistic principles
          in "New Forms in Painting" and "Introduction to the Theory of Pure Form
          in the Theatre."`,

    text: `
          In 1914, Witkiewicz's life took a turn when he joined anthropologist
          Bronisław Malinowski's expedition to the Territory of Papua. This
          venture was disrupted by World War I, leading Witkiewicz to serve as an
          officer in the Imperial Russian Army, a decision that deeply affected
          his father.`,

          Petersburg influenced his philosophical outlook. He claimed to have
          developed his philosophical principles during an artillery barrage and
          was elected as a political commissar of his regiment. His later works
          reflected his concerns about social revolution and foreign invasion,
          often expressed through absurdist language.`,

    heading: `Literary and Artistic Legacy`,
    text: `        Upon his return to Zakopane, Witkiewicz continued to support himself
          through portrait painting. His plays, written during the early 1920s,
          showcased his artistic brilliance, even though only a few found public
          success. In the late 1920s, he transitioned to novel-writing, producing
          works like 'Farewell to Autumn' and 'Insatiability.' The latter work
          delved into geopolitics, psychoactive drugs, and philosophy, earning him
          the Golden Laurel of the Polish Academy of Literature in 1935.
          Witkiewicz's diverse interests also extended to narcotics, which he
          documented in writings, and philosophy. In 1934, he completed his
          renowned drama 'Szewcy,' and he played a crucial role in supporting
          emerging writers like Bruno Schulz.`,

    text: `Following the outbreak of World War II and the invasion of Poland,
          Witkiewicz and his lover, Czesława Oknińska, fled to the remote town of
          Jeziory. The news of the Soviet invasion of Poland in 1939 took a toll
          on Witkiewicz, leading to a tragic decision. On September 18, 1939, he
          ended his own life by overdosing on drugs and attempting to slit his
          wrists. He convinced Czesława to join him, but she miraculously
          survived.`,
